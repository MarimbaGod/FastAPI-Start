## Getting started

You have a project repository, now what?

## Project layout

The layout of the project is just like all of the projects
you did with `docker-compose` in module #2. You will create
a directory in the root of the repository for each service
that you add to your project just like those previous
projects were setup.

### Directories

Several directories have been added to your project. The
directories `docs` and `journals` are places for you and
your team-mates to, respectively, put any documentation
about your project that you create and to put your
project-journal entries. See the _README.md_ file in each
directory for more info.

The other directories, `ghi` and `api`, are services, that
you can start building off of.

Inside of `ghi` is a minimal React app that has an "under
construction" page. It is setup similarly to all of the
other React projects that you have worked on.

Inside of `api` is a minimal FastAPI application.
"Where are all the files?" you might ask? Well, the
`main.py` file is the whole thing, and go take look inside
of it... There's not even much in there..., hmm? That is
FastAPI, we'll learn more about it in the coming days. Can
you figure out what this little web-application does even
though you haven't learned about FastAPI yet?

Also in `api` is a directory for your migrations.
If you choose to use PostgreSQL, then you'll want to use
migrations to control your database. Unlike Django, where
migrations were automatically created for you, you'll write
yours by hand using DDL. Don't worry about not knowing what
DDL means; we have you covered. There's a sample migration
in there that creates two tables so you can see what they
look like.

The Dockerfile and Dockerfile.dev run your migrations
for you automatically.

### Other files

The following project files have been created as a minimal
starting point. Please follow the guidance for each one for
a most successful project.

- `docker-compose.yaml`: there isn't much in here, just a
  **really** simple UI and FastAPI service. Add services
  (like a database) to this file as you did with previous
  projects in module #2.
- `.gitlab-ci.yml`: This is your "ci/cd" file where you will
  configure automated unit tests, code quality checks, and
  the building and deployment of your production system.
  Currently, all it does is deploy an "under construction"
  page to your production UI on GitLab and a sample backend
  to CapRover. We will learn much more about this file.
- `.gitignore`: This is a file that prevents unwanted files
  from getting added to your repository, files like
  `pyc` files, `__pycache__`, etc. We've set it up so that
  it has a good default configuration for Python projects.
- `.env.sample`: This file is a template to copy when
  creating environment variables for your team. Create a
  copy called `.env` and put your own passwords in here
  without fear of it being committed to git (see `.env`
  listed in `.gitignore`). You can also put team related
  environment variables in here, things like api and signing
  keys that shouldn't be committed; these should be
  duplicated in your deployed environments.

### Update GitLab CI/CD variables

Copy the service URL for your CapRover service and then paste
that into the value for the REACT_APP_API_HOST CI/CD variable
in GitLab.
